# Hello TOML

This is an example for how to do some basic parsing with TOML in C++.

## Setup Instructions
The example requires the Conan package manager and CMake.

Python is required by Conan, and if it is installed on your system you can do something the effect of:

``pip install conan``

Once that is done, you can run the following command inside of the project directory.

``conan install .``

To build the project from the command line, use:

``conan build .``

Finally use ``build/bin/hello-toml`` to run the program.

You can use ``cat special-config.toml`` or ``type special-config.toml`` to preview the file generated by the executable.

You can also use your favourite IDE, like Visual Studio or CLion, after doing the ``conan install .`` step.


## Example Overview
The **conanfile.py** defines all of the dependencies and copies the source files to the _packages_ directory.

The **CMakeLists.txt** is the CMake project file for the example. It defines the include directories and build steps for the project.

The _src/main.cpp_ is a program which will read _hello.toml_ and output the contents of the file, in various ways, to the standard output stream, which should be your console/terminal.
